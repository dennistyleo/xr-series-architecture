## Overview

While the core concept is strong, several market-facing gaps limit clarity of value, adoption potential, and user confidence. A total of **9 marketing-related issues** were identified.

---

## 1. Unclear Value Proposition
- Platform benefits not stated in a single clear sentence  
- **Recommendation:** Define a one-line value core message

---

## 2. Vague Target Persona
- MVP does not clearly identify decision-maker vs. practitioner  
- **Recommendation:** Separate personas: Clinician, Data Analyst, Hospital Manager

---

## 3. No Differentiation vs Competitors
- Competitive landscape not referenced  
- **Recommendation:** Build a "Why Intelli-Health" positioning block

---

## 4. AI Feature Messaging Too Technical
- Many users cannot interpret clinical AI terminology  
- **Recommendation:** Use outcome-driven rather than model-driven language

---

## 5. No Proof of Performance
- No metrics, validation, or benchmark results  
- **Recommendation:** Provide even preliminary accuracy/consistency indicators

---

## 6. Onboarding Journey Not Defined
- No walkthrough for new users  
- **Recommendation:** Create a structured onboarding and education flow

---

## 7. Pricing Narrative Missing
- No articulation of how SaaS pricing aligns with value  
- **Recommendation:** Define pricing logic (patient volume, usage hours, etc.)

---

## 8. No Adoption Barrier Strategy
- Healthcare workflows are complex  
- **Recommendation:** Identify points of friction + mitigation plan

---

## 9. No Roadmap Communication
- Users do not know what is coming next  
- **Recommendation:** Publish a high-level product roadmap

---

## Conclusion

The MVP concept is compelling, but clarity and structure in product messaging are required before launching to healthcare professionals or enterprise buyers.
