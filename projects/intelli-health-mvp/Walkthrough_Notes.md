## Purpose of Walkthrough

These notes accompany the recorded video walkthrough delivered to Intelli-Health management and engineering. They highlight flow alignment, UX challenges, AI response behavior, and interaction design observations.

---

## 1. Entry Flow
- Login successful but user orientation missing  
- Recommendation: Add landing overview screen  
- Confusion risk: Users do not know where to start

---

## 2. Data Input
- Input process lacks guardrails  
- No schema validation  
- Users may upload incorrect or incomplete datasets

---

## 3. AI Processing Screen  
- No indication of confidence levels  
- No explanation of how the model interprets inputs  
- Suggest: Add visual trace + model confidence bands

---

## 4. Results Display  
- Results presented without hierarchical grouping  
- Insights appear fragmented  
- Recommend: Group by category + offer drill-down visualization

---

## 5. User Navigation  
- Back/Next links behave inconsistently  
- No global navigation structure  
- Recommend: Introduce persistent side navigation or breadcrumb

---

## 6. Output Interpretation  
- Users unclear how to use results in real clinical workflow  
- Recommend: Add “actionable next steps” section

---

## 7. Missing Error or Warning Indicators  
- Silent failures observed during demo  
- Recommend: Add alert layers for validation, model errors, or missing fields

---

## Summary

The walkthrough confirms that the MVP contains promising capabilities but requires systematic UX, workflow, and AI-response improvements to meet healthcare professional expectations.
